# ToDo
A Node.js powered ToDo app built in flutter. Tasks are stored in an sqlite database.
## Usage
* Run 'npm run start' from within the server directory to start the server
* Make note of the IP address. The app assumes port 8000 as this is hardcoded into the server, so this doesn't need to be specified.
* Build and install the flutter project, either on an emulator or a device
